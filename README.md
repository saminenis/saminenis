### 👋 Hi, I'm Sam!

I'm an engineer and builder focused on **agentic AI** — intelligent systems that can reason, plan, and take autonomous action. My current focus is on **DevOps agents** that bridge traditional infrastructure with modern LLM-based intelligence, enabling software teams to operate faster, safer, and smarter.

### 🤖 What I’m Building

- 🛠️ **DevOps AI Agent** – An autonomous assistant that can deploy services, monitor metrics, respond to alerts, and troubleshoot issues across cloud-native environments. Think of it as an LLM-powered SRE teammate with memory and tools.

---

### 🧭 Areas of Interest

- 🪄 **Generative Agents** – Tools + memory + planning systems for practical autonomy.
- ⚙️ **LLMOps** – Evaluating and observing agent behavior in production settings.
- 🌐 **Infra-AI Fusion** – Making cloud infrastructure accessible and adaptive through AI interfaces.
- 🔍 **Explainable Automation** – Tracing agent decisions, understanding actions, and improving safety.
